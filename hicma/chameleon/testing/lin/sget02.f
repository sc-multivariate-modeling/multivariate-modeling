*  =======
*
*  SGET02 computes the residual for a solution of a system of linear
*  equations  A*x = b  or  A'*x = b:
*     RESID = norm(B - A*X) / ( (norm(A) * norm(X)+ norm(NRHS)) *N * EPS ),
*  where EPS is the machine epsilon.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1

*          = 'N':  A *x = b

*
*  B       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*          On entry, the right hand side vectors for the system of
*          linear equations.
*          On exit, B is overwritten with the difference B - A*X.
