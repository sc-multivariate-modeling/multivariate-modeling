*  equations  A*x = b :
*     RESID = norm(B - A*X,inf) / ( norm(A,inf) * norm(X,inf) * EPS ),
*  where EPS is the machine epsilon.

*          symmetric matrix A is stored:
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows and columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  NRHS    (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of B, the matrix of right hand sides.
*          NRHS >= 0.
*
*  A       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The original M x N matrix A.

*          On entry, the right hand side vectors for the system of
*          linear equations.
*          On exit, B is overwritten with the difference B - A*X.
*
*  LDB     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array B.  IF TRANS = 'N',
*          LDB >= max(1,M); if TRANS = 'T' or 'C', LDB >= max(1,N).
