      SUBROUTINE SLAUU2( UPLO, N, A, LDA, INFO )
*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*  -- LAPACK is a software package provided by Univ. of Tennessee,    --
*  -- Univ. of California Berkeley, Univ. of Colorado Denver and NAG Ltd..--
*     November 2006
*
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      CHARACTER          UPLO
      INTEGER            INFO, LDA, N
*     ..
*     .. Array Arguments ..
      REAL               A( LDA, * )
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SLAUU2 computes the product U * U' or L' * L, where the triangular
*  factor U or L is stored in the upper or lower triangular part of
*  the array A.
*
*  If UPLO = 'U' or 'u' then the upper triangle of the result is stored,
*  overwriting the factor U in A.
*  If UPLO = 'L' or 'l' then the lower triangle of the result is stored,
*  overwriting the factor L in A.
*
*  This is the unblocked form of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies whether the triangular factor stored in the array A
*          is upper or lower triangular:
*          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the triangular factor U or L.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the triangular factor U or L.
*          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the upper triangle of A is
*          overwritten with the upper triangle of the product U * U';
*          if UPLO = 'L', the lower triangle of A is overwritten with
*          the lower triangle of the product L' * L.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
