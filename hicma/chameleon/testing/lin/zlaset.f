*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*     Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley and NAG Ltd..
*     November 2006
*
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      CHARACTER          UPLO
      INTEGER            LDA, M, N
      COMPLEX*16         ALPHA, BETA

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZLASET initializes a 2-D array A to BETA on the diagonal and
*  ALPHA on the offdiagonals.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          Specifies the part of the matrix A to be set.
*          = 'U':      Upper triangular part is set. The lower triangle
*                      is unchanged.
*          = 'L':      Lower triangular part is set. The upper triangle
*                      is unchanged.
*          Otherwise:  All of the matrix A is set.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          On entry, M specifies the number of rows of A.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          On entry, N specifies the number of columns of A.
*
*  ALPHA   (input) COMPLEX*16
*          All the offdiagonal array elements are set to ALPHA.
*
*  BETA    (input) COMPLEX*16
*          All the diagonal array elements are set to BETA.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the m by n matrix A.
*          On exit, A(i,j) = ALPHA, 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, i.ne.j;
*                   A(i,i) = BETA , 1 <= i <= min(m,n)
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
