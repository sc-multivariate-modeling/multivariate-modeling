*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DQRT03 tests DORMQR, which computes Q*C, Q'*C, C*Q or C*Q'.
*
*  DQRT03 compares the results of a call to DORMQR with the results of
*  forming Q explicitly by a call to DORGQR and then performing matrix
*  multiplication by a call to DGEMM.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the orthogonal matrix Q.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows or columns of the matrix C; C is m-by-n if
*          Q is applied from the left, or n-by-m if Q is applied from
*          the right.  N >= 0.
*
*  K       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the
*          orthogonal matrix Q.  M >= K >= 0.
*
*  AF      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          Details of the QR factorization of an m-by-n matrix, as
*          returnedby DGEQRF. See SGEQRF for further details.
*
*  C       (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*
*  CC      (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*
*  Q       (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,M)
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the arrays AF, C, CC, and Q.
*
*  TAU     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors corresponding
*          to the QR factorization in AF.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LWORK)
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of WORK.  LWORK must be at least M, and should be
*          M*NB, where NB is the blocksize for this environment.
*
*  RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
*
*  RESULT  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4)
*          The test ratios compare two techniques for multiplying a
*          random matrix C by an m-by-m orthogonal matrix Q.
*          RESULT(1) = norm( Q*C - Q*C )  / ( M * norm(C) * EPS )
*          RESULT(2) = norm( C*Q - C*Q )  / ( M * norm(C) * EPS )
*          RESULT(3) = norm( Q'*C - Q'*C )/ ( M * norm(C) * EPS )
*          RESULT(4) = norm( C*Q' - C*Q' )/ ( M * norm(C) * EPS )
