      SUBROUTINE DLACN2( N, V, X, ISGN, EST, KASE, ISAVE )
*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*     Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley and NAG Ltd..
*     November 2006
*
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      INTEGER            KASE, N
      DOUBLE PRECISION   EST
*     ..
*     .. Array Arguments ..
      INTEGER            ISGN( * ), ISAVE( 3 )
      DOUBLE PRECISION   V( * ), X( * )
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLACN2 estimates the 1-norm of a square, real matrix A.
*  Reverse communication is used for evaluating matrix-vector products.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N      (input) INTEGER
*         The order of the matrix.  N >= 1.
*
*  V      (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*         On the final return, V = A*W,  where  EST = norm(V)/norm(W)
*         (W is not returned).
*
*  X      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*         On an intermediate return, X should be overwritten by
*               A * X,   if KASE=1,
*               A' * X,  if KASE=2,
*         and DLACN2 must be re-called with all the other parameters
*         unchanged.
*
*  ISGN   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  EST    (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*         On entry with KASE = 1 or 2 and ISAVE(1) = 3, EST should be
*         unchanged from the previous call to DLACN2.
*         On exit, EST is an estimate (a lower bound) for norm(A). 
*
*  KASE   (input/output) INTEGER
*         On the initial call to DLACN2, KASE should be 0.
*         On an intermediate return, KASE will be 1 or 2, indicating
*         whether X should be overwritten by A * X  or A' * X.
*         On the final return from DLACN2, KASE will again be 0.
*
*  ISAVE  (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (3)
*         ISAVE is used to save variables between calls to DLACN2
*
*  Further Details
*  ======= =======
*
*  Contributed by Nick Higham, University of Manchester.
*  Originally named SONEST, dated March 16, 1988.

*  Reference: N.J. Higham, "FORTRAN codes for estimating the one-norm of
*  a real or complex matrix, with applications to condition estimation",
*  ACM Trans. Math. Soft., vol. 14, no. 4, pp. 381-396, December 1988.
*
*  This is a thread safe version of DLACON, which uses the array ISAVE
*  in place of a SAVE statement, as follows:
*
*     DLACON     DLACN2
*      JUMP     ISAVE(1)
*      J        ISAVE(2)
*      ITER     ISAVE(3)
