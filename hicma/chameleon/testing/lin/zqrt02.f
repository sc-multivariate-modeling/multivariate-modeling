*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ZQRT02 tests ZUNGQR, which generates an m-by-n matrix Q with
*  orthonornmal columns that is defined as the product of k elementary
*  reflectors.
*
*  Given the QR factorization of an m-by-n matrix A, ZQRT02 generates
*  the orthogonal matrix Q defined by the factorization of the first k
*  columns of A; it compares R(1:n,1:k) with Q(1:m,1:n)'*A(1:m,1:k),
*  and checks that the columns of Q are orthonormal.
