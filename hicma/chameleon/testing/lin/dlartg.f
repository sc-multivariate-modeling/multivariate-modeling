      SUBROUTINE DLARTG( F, G, CS, SN, R )
*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*     Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley and NAG Ltd..
*     November 2006
*
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      DOUBLE PRECISION   CS, F, G, R, SN
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLARTG generate a plane rotation so that
*
*     [  CS  SN  ]  .  [ F ]  =  [ R ]   where CS**2 + SN**2 = 1.
*     [ -SN  CS  ]     [ G ]     [ 0 ]
*
*  This is a slower, more accurate version of the BLAS1 routine DROTG,
*  with the following other differences:
*     F and G are unchanged on return.
*     If G=0, then CS=1 and SN=0.
*     If F=0 and (G .ne. 0), then CS=0 and SN=1 without doing any
*        floating point operations (saves work in DBDSQR when
*        there are zeros on the diagonal).
*
*  If F exceeds G in magnitude, CS will be positive.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  F       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The first component of vector to be rotated.
*
*  G       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The second component of vector to be rotated.
*
*  CS      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The cosine of the rotation.
*
*  SN      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The sine of the rotation.
*
*  R       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The nonzero component of the rotated vector.
*
*  This version has a few statements commented out for thread safety
*  (machine parameters are computed on each entry). 10 feb 03, SJH.
