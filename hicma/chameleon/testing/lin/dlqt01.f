*  matrix A, and partially tests DORGLQ which forms the n-by-n
*  orthogonal matrix Q.
*
*  DLQT01 compares L with A*Q', and checks that Q is orthogonal.

*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The m-by-n matrix A.
*
*  AF      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          Details of the LQ factorization of A, as returned by DGELQF.
*          See DGELQF for further details.
*
*  Q       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          The n-by-n orthogonal matrix Q.
